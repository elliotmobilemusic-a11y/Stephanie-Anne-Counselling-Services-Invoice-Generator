üßæ Counselling Invoice GeneratorA single-file HTML/JavaScript application designed for Stephanie Anne's Counselling Services to quickly generate, manage, and print invoices. This application uses modern web standards and integrates with Google Cloud Firestore for persistent data storage.‚ú® FeaturesResponsive Design: Looks great and is fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices (uses Tailwind CSS).Invoice Number Persistence: Automatically saves and increments the next invoice number using Firestore.Client Data Persistence: Saves the client's billing information for quick loading on future invoices.Dynamic Line Items: Easily add, remove, and update service lines with automatic calculation of totals.Cancellation Policy Integration: Pre-configured line items and rates for standard counselling sessions and cancellation fees.Print Ready: Dedicated print styles hide controls and format the output cleanly for PDF download or physical printing.‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Data PersistenceSince this application uses Firebase Firestore for persistence, it requires specific configuration to run externally.Local Development / Self-HostingThe Firebase integration relies on three global variables (__app_id, __firebase_config, and __initial_auth_token) which are automatically provided in the specific Canvas environment this app was developed in.To run this locally or host on GitHub Pages:Remove the Authentication Logic: You will need to remove or comment out the entire initializeFirebase function and the usage of getAuth, signInWithCustomToken, and onAuthStateChanged as the environment variables are not available.Define Static IDs: You would need to manually replace the dynamic Firebase document reference functions (getInvoiceDocRef, getClientDocRef, etc.) with static placeholders, or set up your own Firebase project and inject your own configuration (API key, etc.) and anonymous authentication logic.For simple, non-persistent local use:If you only need the invoice calculations and print functionality without saving the invoice number or client data:Remove the entire <script type="module"> block containing the Firebase imports and logic.The application will still function as a calculator and generator, but the Save Invoice Number and Save Client buttons will stop working, and the fields will not persist.üìù UsageFill in Invoice Details: Enter the Invoice # (which can be saved and incremented), Date, and Due Date.Enter Client Details: Input the client's name and address. Click "Save Client" to store this information for next time.Add Line Items: Use the dropdown menu to select services (In-Person, Online, or Cancellation Fee) and adjust the Rate or Quantity as needed.Print: Click the "Print / Download Invoice" button to open the print dialog, allowing you to save the formatted invoice as a PDF.
